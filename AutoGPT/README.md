# Thought implementation in LLMs
While LLms are advancing towards human level intelligence in many fields,
the thought processes that characterize a human are far from being 
implemented in the standard full stack implementations of 
currently available models.

This project aims to implement the thought process in LLMs, 
through the implementation of N distinct contributions:
1. A long term memory
2. A routine to access the long term memory and retrieve only relevant content
3. an organized scientific process through which the world model is updated
4.
